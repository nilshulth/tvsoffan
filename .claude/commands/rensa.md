# This is a command to clean up the codebase.

For all the actions below remember that this is a minimalistic project. Do not suggest complicated solutions, new frameworks, new processes, etc. This is maintained by a single person.

1. Read the @README.md file and the @schema.sql file. Check if the codebase and those files are in sync. If not, ask the user which one to update.
2. Review the codebase for any unused files, functions, classes, etc. Suggest alternatives and ask the user what to do.
3. Review the codebase for multiple definitions of the same function, class, etc. Suggest alternatives and ask the user what to do.
4. Review the codebase for duplicate code / functionality that is better handled by a single function, class, etc. Suggest alternatives and ask the user what to do.
5. Do an architecture review of the codebase. Suggest alternatives and ask the user what to do
